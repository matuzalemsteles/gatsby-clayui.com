Feel free to choose a specific version of the [CDN](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/clay) if you want to keep track of the changes we make. But if you feel at ease and want to keep Clay always up to date, move on.

## CSS

> Use any of the available automatic cdn distributions and copy-paste the stylesheet `<link>` into your `<head>` before all other stylesheets to load our Atlas skin.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/clay/lib/css/atlas.css">
```

## JS

> If you want to go beyond the static HTML, add our bundled library to get access to the full power of Clay!
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/clay/lib/js/clay.js"></script>
```
